Day 2 of #100daysofcode - Coderbyte Challenge 4 - Letter Changes

This was a challenging one. Looking at different solutions, I discovered Javascript Regex which is something for further study.
The code I worked from in this solution was from a Medium article written by someone also on the #100daysofcode challenge:

I have added my own comments to the code I have chosen as a solution to show my understanding. This code made the most sense to me.
I will be revisiting topics such as Char codes and .replace in JS.
